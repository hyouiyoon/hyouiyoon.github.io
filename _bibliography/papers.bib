  title="{Designing Lightweight Nanolattices: Multiscale Optimization of Geometry and Size Effects}",

  abstract={Lattice–truss structures have emerged as lightweight architected materials capable of achieving exceptional stiffness-to-weight ratios through geometry-driven design. Nanolattice architectures—composed of periodic networks of nanoscale beams—offer an opportunity to realize lightweight yet mechanically robust materials, whose properties can surpass those of bulk alternatives. However, the mechanical behavior of nanolattices remains difficult to predict accurately, as intrinsic size effects due to surface stresses can substantially alter nanolattice properties. Although multiscale approaches coupling atomistic simulations with continuum models have been employed, the individual contributions of surface-induced stresses and geometric design to nanolattice stiffness have not been clearly distinguished. To address this issue, this study introduces a unified multiscale framework that explicitly separates and quantifies surface-stress effects and beam geometry effects in nanolattice structures. By coupling molecular statics (MS) simulations with finite element analysis (FEA), the mechanical behaviors of body-centered (BC) and octet-truss (OT) lattices are evaluated under controlled beam geometries and lattice size variations. The results demonstrate that the optimal geometries identified at the continuum scale remain valid at the nanoscale when surface effects are incorporated. Surface-stress-corrected MS results exhibit strong agreement with FEA predictions, confirming that geometry-driven stress redistribution, rather than intrinsic surface tension, governs the effective stiffness response. Both BC and OT lattices exhibit a size-dependent stiffening trend, originating from the increase in the axial stiffness of individual nanobeams as their diameter decreases. These findings elucidate how geometry, scale, and surface energy collectively govern mechanical stiffness in nanolattices, providing fundamental design guidelines for lightweight and high-stiffness nanoscale architectures.},

  title="{Layered Hybrid Lattice Architectures for Broadband Electromagnetic Absorption and Improved Structural Stiffness}",
  author={Yoon, Hyoui and Lim, Dahyun Daniel and Gu, Grace X. and Lee, Sangryun},
  abstract={Electromagnetic interference (EMI) presents a critical challenge across application areas such as wireless communication networks, defense technologies, and electronic devices. Although metamaterial absorbers offer excellent electromagnetic (EM) wave attenuation, their limited mechanical stiffness restricts their use in structurally demanding environments. This study introduces a new class of layered hybrid lattice absorbers that concurrently achieve broadband EM wave absorption and enhanced mechanical stiffness. Three-layer hybrid lattices are developed by combining simple cubic (SC), body-centered cubic (BC), and octet-truss (OT) architectures in diverse configurations. The relationship between broadband absorption and mechanical performance is then examined as a function of lattice arrangement. Finite element simulations are used to evaluate EM responses and effective stiffness across the 4–18 GHz frequency range. Results show that placing an OT lattice in the upper layer yields an average EM absorption exceeding 95% owing to effective impedance matching, while the middle layer governs the redistribution of residual energy within the stack. Incorporating an SC lattice in the lower layer enhances the structure’s load-bearing capacity. We find that the OT-SC-SC configuration maintains strong EM absorption while providing approximately 36% greater stiffness in the out-of-plane (vertical stacking) direction and 118% greater stiffness in the in-plane directions relative to the benchmark OT-OT-OT configuration. These findings highlight that tailored spatial arrangement of lattice types enables simultaneous optimization of EM and mechanical functionalities. Positioning an OT lattice at the top and SC lattice at the bottom is demonstrated to be an effective strategy for developing multifunctional metamaterial absorbers. This approach offers a foundational framework for next-generation absorbers targeting advanced EMI shielding and mechanically resilient applications.},
