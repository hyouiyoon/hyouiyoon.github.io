Welcome to my space!

I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering from Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2025.

I am currently a Master’s student in the Computational Materials Modeling & Design (CMMD) Lab under the supervision of Prof. Sangryun Lee, where I focus on integrating computational mechanics with data-driven methodologies for advanced material and structural design.

My work centers on developing computational methods that bring together physical modeling and data-driven approaches to support more effective material and structural design.

Please feel free to contact me anytime!



**Research interests:** Data-driven design, Design optimization, Multiphysics modeling
